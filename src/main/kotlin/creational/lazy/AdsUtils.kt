/**
 * The Lazy Initialization Pattern delays the creation of an object until it is actually needed.
 * This approach can be useful for optimizing resource usage and improving application
 * performance by avoiding unnecessary object creation.
 *
 * Advantages
 * 1. Resource Efficiency: Reduces memory usage by only initializing objects when required.
 * 2. Improved Performance: Can speed up application startup by deferring object creation.
 * 3. Reduced Overhead: Avoids the cost of creating objects that might not be used.
 * 4. Thread Safety: In many implementations (e.g., Kotlinâ€™s by lazy),
 * initialization is thread-safe by default.
