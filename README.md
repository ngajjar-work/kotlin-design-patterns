# Kotlin Design Patterns for Android Development

Welcome to the Kotlin Design Patterns for Android Development repository! This project aims to demonstrate popular design patterns implemented in Kotlin specifically tailored for Android development. It serves as a reference and learning resource for Android developers looking to apply best practices and idiomatic Kotlin code in their projects.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. This category includes patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.

### Structural Patterns
Structural design patterns focus on object composition or the structure of classes. They explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. This category includes patterns such as Adapter, Composite, Proxy, Decorator, and Facade.

### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral design patterns are concerned with how objects interact and communicate with each other. They emphasize the communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities among objects. This category includes patterns such as Observer, Strategy, Command, Iterator, and State.
